	  	<h2>Solution</h2>

	  	  <h3>Workspace</h3>

	  	    <p>Bringing this function out from the hamburger menu and down to the action menu solves the trouble of reaching this primary function. This way the Workspace is more accessible and one less click away.</p>

	  	    <p>We also wanted to better highlight if there is a new message in another workspace. As things are now, if you’re in workspace A there is no notification for workspace B. When pressing the workspace button in the action menu all workspaces will expand upwards on the screen, displaying notifications.</p>

	  	  <h3>#</h3>

	  	    <p>Just like the Group-button, # was also hidden under the hamburger menu, now one click less away. At first we were considering separating #, threads and private messaging into separate functions but we decided not to reinvent too much, changing things that are not really a problem.</p>

	  	  <h3>Write</h3>

	  	    <p>Although this is a key function of the Slack service it doesn’t need to be displayed straight away. We hid the messaging function under WRITE. This function brings forth the keyboard and messaging functions, basically as they are today.</p>

	  	  <h3>Search</h3>

	  	    <p>Bringing down the search function to the action menu, gathering all function in the action menu.</p>

	  	  <h3>Profile</h3>

	  	    <p>Even though the profile section is not very accessible in the bottom right corner of the action menu it is not one of the primary action buttons. Also, we gather everything in the action menu at the bottom instead of having some action at the top and at the bottom.</p>
